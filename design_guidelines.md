# Amazonas Biophilic Tour Booking Platform - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based with Biophilic Principles**: Drawing inspiration from Airbnb's immersive travel experience combined with nature-first biophilic design theory. This creates an emotional connection to the Amazon rainforest through digital design.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Nature Immersion**: Every element should evoke the living, breathing Amazon ecosystem
2. **Organic Flow**: Avoid rigid grids; embrace natural, flowing layouts
3. **Visual Storytelling**: Use imagery to transport users into the rainforest experience
4. **Calm Engagement**: Design should feel restorative, not overwhelming
